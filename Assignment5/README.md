# Control Theory Homework 5
This is the first homework for Control Theory course (Innopolis University)
My variant is **a**. 

Everything was executed on my computer on Windows 10.

## Report
Report files are: [report.pdf](report.pdf) - read it, it is the report in pdf format.

## Simulink Scheme

Tasks E, F and G are solved in Simulink. You can find the schemes in the report. These are Simulink files if you want to run them on your computer:

## MATLAB code

Task I (inverted pendulum discrete system) - [code](ss2dt.m)

Workspace variables for tasks E, F and G - [code](vars.m)

## Python Code

All the code is written in Python Notebook. You can find it [here](hw5.ipynb)

For running all the Python code you need to install Jupyter Notebook on your computer.

I used Python 3.7.3.

NumPy library should be installed too.

If you do not have Jupyter Notebook and you do not want to install it then you can upload the notebooks to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
