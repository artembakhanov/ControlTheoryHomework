# Control Theory Assignment 2

In this directory you can find all the files that was produces during solving the second assignment.

You can read my report [HERE](report.pdf).

Other resources (including Matlab code) can be found in the directory called [/sources](/sources).

I solved some problems using Matlab 9.6 (Symbolic Math Toolbox 8.3 is required to run my code) and Simulink.
